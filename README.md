  * Forensic Psychology, 3e is “the” Canadian source of stimulating and accessible course materials for Forensic Psychology courses from some of the biggest names in the discipline. It takes a broad-based perspective that incorporates both experimental and clinical topics and presents the important ideas, issues, and research in a way that everyone will understand and enjoy, and in some cases find useful in their careers. The text covers topics that might otherwise be discussed in traditional social and cognitive psychology courses–including eyewitness testimony, jury decision making, and police procedures–as well as topics that are clinical in nature and might otherwise be discussed in traditional personality or abnormal psychology courses–such as the meaning of being unfit to stand trial, mentally disordered offenders, and psychopathy.
